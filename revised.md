Through multiple linear regression with model refinement and diagnostics, we identified key predictors—such as school language, special education proportion, and indicators of socioeconomic status—that collectively explain meaningful variation in OSSLT first-attempt pass rates across Ontario schools.

## Key Findings

- OSSLT performance is closely linked to socioeconomic background. Students from **low-income households** or whose **parents lack post-secondary education** tend to have lower success rates. This aligns with the findings of @zhang2020family, who emphasized the impact of family income and parental education on academic outcomes.

- Schools with a higher proportion of students receiving **special education services** show reduced OSSLT performance, with the negative effect becoming stronger as the proportion increases. This supports the work of @vaughn2014intensive, who documented the academic challenges often faced by students in special education, even when accommodations are provided.

- **French-language schools** generally perform better on the OSSLT than English-language schools, despite the test being administered in English. This contrasts with the expectation from @bernhofer2022effect, who suggested that students perform best when instructed in their first language. Our findings suggest that other institutional or pedagogical factors may be contributing to this result.

- **School type (Catholic vs. Public)** does not appear to significantly affect OSSLT outcomes after accounting for other factors. This differs from the conclusion of @cheema2024difference, who found that private or religiously affiliated schools often outperform public ones. Our model suggests that socioeconomic and instructional variables may be more influential.
